## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Scss
- Postcss 
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned
It cost a lot of time to get used to react,but I think next time I can do it more faster and accurate.
Beside that, I encounter some challenge for deploy vite+react project to the github pages,
system keep telling me that I have some unexpect error (spawn ENAMETOOLONG) and I really don't know how to deal with that!
I search for many infofmation and ask AI, and I finally figure out the solution!
I use .sh to help me deploy website, and it really pleasure to see my work finally could be seen on github! 


### Continued development

I want to get more familiar with react, so I will keep practise that in the futrue practise!
